# Cauliflower with Oranges Recipe (Dunya Mutfagindan)

## **Ingredients**

- 1 small head Cauliflower
- 1 tsp Ginger, ground
- 2 Onions
- 3 Oranges
- 2 Potatoes
- 1 Serrano or bird's eye chili
- 2 tsp Garam masala
- 1 tsp Granulated sugar
- 1 tsp Red chili powder
- 1 tsp Turmeric, ground
- 1/4 cup Vegetable oil
- 2 tsp Cumin, ground
- 1/2 cup Water

- ## **Direction**

- Place the cauliflower, onions, and potatoes in a large bowl, and sprinkle with the turmeric, tossing to coat.
- Heat the oil in a large heavy-bottomed nonreactive skillet over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the vegetables. Stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden and lightly browned. Transfer the vegetables to a bowl, and set aside.
- Add a touch more oil to the pan, still over medium heat. Add the cumin, garam masala, ground ginger, and chili powder, and roast until they begin to change colour and become increasingly fragrant.
- Add the reserved vegetables to the pan, then add the oranges and sugar. Add the water to deglaze the pan. Cover and reduce the heat to a gentle simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked but are still slightly firm.
- Add the chilies, if using, for the last 5 minutes of cooking time. Serve with rice.
  
- Afiyet olsun!
